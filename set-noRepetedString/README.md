## Data Structures

### Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Here, you'll find implementations and examples of queue operations.

### Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This section contains stack implementations and usage examples.

### Binary Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure with nodes that have up to two children. This section includes various types of binary trees and related operations.

### Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node. This section covers singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. This section provides implementations and examples of hash tables.

### Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. This section covers different types of graphs and graph operations.

### Recursion
Recursion is a function that calls itself and has two cases. The base case and the recursive case.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
This section includes implementations of various sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, and more.

### Search Algorithms
Here, you'll find different search algorithms like binary search, linear search, and depth-first search.

### Graph Algorithms
This section covers graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and others.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. This section includes examples and solutions using dynamic programming techniques.
